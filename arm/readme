ARM - Azure Resource Manager

ARM is built on JSON. So it has some inheritted issues
- No easy way to add comments
- A lot of noise in the script (simple things sometimes are hard to do)
- Functions within the strings
- Becomes hard to maintain as it grows
- Requires hardcoded resource ID's to use secrets from key vault
- Limited support for configurations and working with resources after creation
    - E.g. no way to add a secret to a key vault

Good things about ARM
- Tried and tested
- Fairely robust
- Many example templates from MS
- Tooling support
- Can retrieve secrets from key vault when deploying
