Working with PS variables
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
variable always starts with $ sign. 

$process = Get-Process >> this defines a variable $process and assigns the collection of objects returned by Get-Process
$process | Where-Object {$_.CPU -gt 5000}
$process | Sort-Object WorkingSet64 -Descending

**PowerShell is not strongly typed

$psvar = "text" >> if you load a string, it becomes a string type variable
$psvar = 4 >> if you load a number, it becomes a number type

**Type conversion
[int]$num1 = '2' >> converts the string to integer and assigns to $num1
[int]$num2 = '2'
$total = $num1 + $num2

$var1 = $total.ToString() >> converts integer to string 

**Single Quote vs Double Quote
$literal = 'Two plus one equals: $(1 + 2)' >> the entire string is treated as literal 
$literal

$escaped = "Two plus one equals: $(1 + 2)" >> here the liternal within $() is evaluated. 
$escaped

**Reservered variables
Get-Variable >> returns the list of reserved variables

**Reserver environment variables
Get-ChildItem env:

**Invoking environment variable
$env:COMPUTERNAME
